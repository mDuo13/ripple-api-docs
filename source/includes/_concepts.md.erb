# Basic Types

## Ripple Address

```json
"r9cZA1mLK5R5Am25ArfXFmqgNwjZgnfk59"
```

Every Ripple account has an address, which is a base58-encoding of a hash of the account's public key.

## Account Sequence Number

Every Ripple account has a sequence number that is used to order transactions. Every transaction must have a sequence number and transaction can only be executed in order by sequence number. This prevents one transaction from executing twice and transactions executing out of order.

## Currency

Currencies are represented as either 3-character currency codes or 40-character uppercase hexadecimal strings. We recommend using uppercase [ISO 4217 Currency Codes](http://www.xe.com/iso4217.php) only. The string "XRP" is disallowed. The following characters are permitted: all uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, as well as the symbols `?`, `!`, `@`, `#`, `$`, `%`, `^`, `&`, `*`, `<`, `>`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, and `|`.

## Amount

```json
{
  "currency": "USD",
  "counterparty": "rMH4UxPrbuMa1spCBR98hLLyNJp4d8p4tM",
  "value": "100"
}
```

```json
{
  "currency": "XRP",
  "value": "2000"
}
```

Represents an amount of a currency.
